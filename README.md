Extracting the attendance of online Zoom meetings orÂ Classes using R

One of the challenges in the online Zoom meetings/classes is how to
mark attendance, particularly when the number of attendees is large
and frequently enter and exit the meeting room . Some of my
colleagues and I at the Melbourne Institute of Technology (MIT) used a
simple R program for two trimesters and found it convenient and
useful. The R programming is selected because R is easy to install by
most people. I tried to make it as simple as possible.
